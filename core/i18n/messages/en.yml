    🧧 <b>Red Packet Game</b>
    Send packets in groups/DM, grab packets, view rankings and records.
    Supports USDT / TON / ⭐ points. Multiple modes, easy to start!
  howto:
    title: "🎮 How it works"
    steps: |-
      • 🧧 <b>Send</b>: choose token → total amount → shares → random (luck) → send.
      • 🤲 <b>Grab</b>: click “Grab now” on the card. Random amount, pure luck!
      • 🏆 <b>Ranking</b>: view “Best Luck” and records after each round ends.
      • 📊 <b>Today’s stats</b>: your send/grab amounts and counts for today.
      • 💳 <b>Top up / Withdraw</b>: supports USDT / TON. On-chain confirmation may take time.
  rules:
    title: "📜 Basic rules"
    points: |-
      • ⏱ The packet is open during its validity; remaining amount is refunded after timeout.
      • 👤 Each user can only grab once per round. Repeated clicks will be refused.
      • 🧮 <b>Luck = random split</b>, not equal. You might get the most, or possibly 0.
      • 🔄 Forwarding the packet card is supported (if enabled for the round).
      • 🧾 All balance changes are recorded in the “Ledger” for audit.
  fair:
    title: "⚖️ Fairness"
    points: |-
      • 🎲 RNG: based on high-quality PRNG (Python secrets/random); amounts are drawn independently with sum guaranteed; <b>no user is favored</b>.
      • 🚫 Anti-cheat: one valid grab per user/device; rate-limit and bot behavior will be blocked.
      • 💠 Transparent & auditable: all send/grab events record time, amount and token; anomalies can be investigated.
      • 📨 Permission checks: posting only in groups where the bot has rights, preventing delivery failure or tampering.
      • 🛠 Fallback: on delivery failure, auto refund or ask to retry. No funds swallowed.
